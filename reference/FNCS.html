    <p>The FNCS reflects the impact of a paper relative to a reference set, namely publications of the same type (typically, journal articles), published in the same year, and in the same field. The “same field” can be operationalized, for example, by the top-level concepts as assigned by the OpenAlex database. Once a reference set has been compiled, the FNCS of a paper is computed as the raw citation count divided by the average citation count of papers in the reference set. It can be interpreted as a ratio: A value of 1 means that a paper has received as many citations as an average paper in the reference set, 2 means that it received two times as many citations.
The percentage rank is the "CP-EX" measure described in Bornmann &amp; Williams (2020), which returns the percentage of publications with strictly less citations (and <em>not</em> "less or equal"). As many publications have 0 citations, the alternative CP-IN measure (which return "less or equal") returns often very high percentiles although a paper has 0 citations. This is not intuitive.
